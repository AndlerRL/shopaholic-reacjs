<h1> Shopaholic e-commerce app </h1>

<p> This project has been created base on the Turing Front-End Challenge –– Cheers! </p>

<p> Here I will demonstrate how I can build web sites end to end, using: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>React 16.8.6</code>.</li>
  <li><code>React Redux</code>.</li>
  <li><code>React Router</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Redux Saga</code>.</li>
  <li><code>React Thunk</code> (as a Middleware).</li>
  <li><code>Axios</code> (AJAX for React).</li>
  <li><code>Material UI</code> (Some components; the majority are components created by myself.</li>
  <li>Webpack.</li>
  <li>CSS Modules (with PostCSS loader).</li>
  <li><code>Babel</code>.</li>
  <li>Of course, <code>ES6</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation:</h2>

<p>On this project I have divided into 3 main folders, <code>Components</code>, <code>Containers</code> and <code>Store</code>. Also some additional ones, as the Higher Order Components (hoc), the Utilities Functions (share) and Assets folder.</p>

<p>As it looks, has UI, Navigation and soon, Pages components within it and will be connected to the containers folder, where all logic goes.</p>

<h6>How to run it?</h6>

<p>If you have npm package installed, just follow this steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>On terminal, go to the main folder <code>./shopaholic-app</code>.</li>
  <li>Then in terminal write <code>npm install</code>.</li>
  <li>After installation complete, write <code>npm start</code>.</li>
  <li>A browser will open, if it is already open, a new tab will appear.</li>
  <li>Enjoy & Test!</li>
</ol>

<p>Any question or something, you can email me (it's on my main page within GitHub).</p>

<p>Now, let's go to the changelog!</p>

<p>Started to create components, principally the Layout and has some responsive interactions. like:</p>
<ul>

  <li><b>Modal and Backdrop created:</b> Custom UI Components that, actually work good!</li>
  <li><b>Icons components:</b> This Component it's actually a Material UI component, but for re-use and the code doesn't turns a bit cumbersome, decided to create it for more readable code.</li>
</ul>
